## Project Background & Scope
According to a popular website on the topic of living and working in Singapore1, it reported that the quality of life is often used as a shorthand for measuring how good one feels about one’s life. There are formal procedures for calculating this measure that includes factors such as economic, social, physical, political, and spiritual well-being. Singapore may be the smallest country in Southeast Asia, but it has emerged as one of the best places to live in Asia with a very high quality of life measurement.
Singapore has been ranked as the top city in Asia in terms of quality of living according to global human resource consultancy, Mercer. Singapore is also regarded as the ‘Happiest country in Southeast Asia’ according to the 2018 World Happiness Report2.

**Hypothesis Statement: Based on the report, it seems that Singapore is a good place to live / work in. Is this true?**
